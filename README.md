## Installation

### Windows

1. Download the installation package: [AICodingOfficer_windows.zip](https://github.com/etShaw-zh/AICodingAssistant-Pro/releases)
2. Unzip the installation package
3. Run `AICodingOfficer.exe`

### macOS

2. Unzip the installation package
3. Run `AICodingOfficer.app`

    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Solving the issue of "Application 'xxx' cannot be opened" on Mac

    - First, right-click on the application and select 'Show Package Contents'
    - Then, expand 'Contents' - 'MacOS', find the corresponding file AICodingOfficer
    - Next, open the terminal and enter the following code (note that there are spaces before and after +x):
        
        ```shell
        chmod +x
        ```
        
    - Then drag the file AICodingOfficer into the terminal (to input the complete execution path). The complete command is as follows:
        
        ```shell
        chmod +x /Users/xiaojianjun/Downloads/AICodingOfficer.app/Contents/MacOS/AICodingOfficer
        ```

    - Finally, press Enter. At this point, the file that was originally of unknown type in Finder has now become a Unix executable file, and the icon has also become normal.
    - Reopen the downloaded software, and you will find that the downloaded program can be used and executed normally!
    - If it still cannot be opened, go to Settings, Security & Privacy, find the prompt information, and click to run and open it.
